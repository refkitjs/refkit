# @refkit/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 451271b: Add `SearchInput.poolFactor`: overfetch a wider candidate pool per provider (default 4×, capped at 100/source) before merge/rerank/gate, then narrow to `limit`. Fixes pool starvation — dedup and ranking now operate on real candidates instead of a source-truncated slice. Non-finite or `< 1` factors fall back to the default.

  Also: `buildAttribution` now includes the precise `licenseVersion` (e.g. "CC-BY 4.0" instead of "CC-BY") when the source provides it.

### Patch Changes

- fa930f9: Fix a latent stack overflow in `mergeReferences`: the RRF max-normaliser used
  `Math.max(...score.values())`, which throws `RangeError: Maximum call stack size
exceeded` once the merged pool gets large (~10^5 unique results) — the same
  spread-overflow already guarded against in `lexicalReranker`'s quality pass. It
  now computes the max with a reduce loop, preserving the "top result relevance =
  exactly 1.0" invariant, and the inaccurate "empty input returns [] earlier"
  comment is corrected.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e27c09: Widen the rerank seam to { query, refs, signal } and add a zero-dependency
  lexicalReranker (query term-coverage + resolution/license weighting + MMR-lite
  source diversity). Model-based rerankers stay BYO via the hook.
