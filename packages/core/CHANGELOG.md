# @refkit/core

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 991d467: Add first-class CC NC/ND license families: `CC-BY-NC`, `CC-BY-NC-SA`, `CC-BY-NC-ND`, `CC-BY-ND`.

  NC/ND-licensed results no longer collapse to `proprietary`: they keep their real
  family id (+ CC version), generate the attribution the license requires, and
  verdicts name the actual license in their reasons. Gating stays strict-deny —
  commercial/AI use of NC content is still denied; NC × `redistribution` intent now
  returns `needs-review` (was `denied`) because the intent cannot distinguish
  commercial from non-commercial redistribution. `CC-BY-ND` now correctly allows
  verbatim commercial reuse (`allowed-with-attribution`) while AI/derivative use
  stays denied.

  Note for TypeScript consumers: exhaustive `switch` statements over `LicenseId`
  need arms for the four new ids.

- 8300c18: Export evaluatePermissions/PermissionKey/EvaluateOptions — programmable strict-deny gate; evaluateUse intents are now presets over it (behavior unchanged).
- c6b6061: Harden the search orchestrator: per-provider soft timeout (default 10s) and
  bounded retry on 429/5xx/network errors (default 1, exponential backoff) — on by
  default, tunable or disabled via `createRefkit({ resilience })`. Provider
  statuses in `searchWithMeta` now carry `latencyMs`, and supplying a `cache`
  (`KeyValueCache`) now memoizes per-provider results (key
  `refkit:v1:<provider>:<queryHash>`, TTL via the new `cacheTtlMs` option, default
  5 min) with hits flagged `cached: true`. Merge, rerank, and the license gate
  always run fresh. New exports: `withTimeout`, `retryingFetch`, and the
  `ResilienceOptions`, `TimeoutHandle`, `RetryOptions` types.

  The MCP `search_references` structured output (`explain: true`) now surfaces
  `latencyMs` per provider and `cached` on cache hits.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b16960: Add shared provider helpers to @refkit/core (setIf\* URL setters, first, mapCcDeedUrl, mapRightsUrl, image-URL heuristics) and refactor all providers to use them instead of per-package copies.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c221f8: Add unified search controls, provider capability metadata, MCP controls input, search metadata/explanations, practical provider-specific `providerOptions` whitelists, and a core duplicate hook for agent-facing searches.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 451271b: Add `SearchInput.poolFactor`: overfetch a wider candidate pool per provider (default 4×, capped at 100/source) before merge/rerank/gate, then narrow to `limit`. Fixes pool starvation — dedup and ranking now operate on real candidates instead of a source-truncated slice. Non-finite or `< 1` factors fall back to the default.

  Also: `buildAttribution` now includes the precise `licenseVersion` (e.g. "CC-BY 4.0" instead of "CC-BY") when the source provides it.

### Patch Changes

- fa930f9: Fix a latent stack overflow in `mergeReferences`: the RRF max-normaliser used
  `Math.max(...score.values())`, which throws `RangeError: Maximum call stack size
exceeded` once the merged pool gets large (~10^5 unique results) — the same
  spread-overflow already guarded against in `lexicalReranker`'s quality pass. It
  now computes the max with a reduce loop, preserving the "top result relevance =
  exactly 1.0" invariant, and the inaccurate "empty input returns [] earlier"
  comment is corrected.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e27c09: Widen the rerank seam to { query, refs, signal } and add a zero-dependency
  lexicalReranker (query term-coverage + resolution/license weighting + MMR-lite
  source diversity). Model-based rerankers stay BYO via the hook.
